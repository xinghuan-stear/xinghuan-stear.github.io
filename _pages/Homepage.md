My research interests lie in algebraic geometry, commutative
algebra, and arithmetic geometry. In particular, I am interested in
using homological methods to study the geometry of zero loci of
systems of polynomials (i.e. algebraic varieties). I am also
interested in studying the arithmetic properties of varieties over
finite fields. Further, I am passionate about promoting inclusivity,
diversity, and justice in the mathematics community.

Before coming to UC, Berkeley I was a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison
